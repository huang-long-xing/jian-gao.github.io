        <strong>Abstract:</strong> This article presents a study on freeway networks instrumented with coordinated ramp metering and the ability of such control systems
        to produce arbitrarily complex congestion patterns within the dynamical limits of the traffic system. The developed method is used to
        evaluate the potential for an adversary with access to control infrastructure to enact high-level attacks on the underlying freeway system. 
        The attacks are executed using a predictive, coordinated ramp metering controller based on finite-horizon optimal control 
        and multi-objective optimization techniques. The efficacy of the control schemes in carrying out the prescribed attacks is determined
        via simulations of traffic network models based on the cell transmission model with onramps modeled as queue buffers. 
        Freeway attacks with high-level objectives are presented on two illustrative examples: congestion-on-demand, 
        which aims to create precise, user-specified pockets of congestion, and catch-me-if-you-can, which attempts to aid a fleeing vehicle from pursuant vehicles.

        <p><strong>Abstract:</strong> With the emergence of ride-sharing companies that offer transportation on demand at a large scale and the increasing availability of corresponding demand datasets, new challenges arise to develop routing optimization algorithms that can solve massive problems in real time. In this paper, we develop an optimization framework, coupled with a novel and generalizable backbone algorithm, that allows us to dispatch in real time thousands of taxis serving more than 25,000 customers per hour. We provide evidence from historical simulations using New York City routing network and yellow cabs data to show that our algorithms improve upon the performance of existing heuristics in such real-world settings.

        <strong>Abstract:</strong> Twenty-first century urban planners have identified the understanding of complex city traffic patterns as a major priority, leading
        to a sharp increase in the amount and the diversity of traffic data being collected. For instance, taxi companies in an increasing number of major cities have
        started recording metadata for every individual car ride. In this paper, we show that we can leverage network optimization insights to extract accurate travel 
        time estimations from such origin-destination data, using information from a large number of taxi trips to reconstruct the traffic patterns in an entire city 
        on a variety of timescales. We develop a method that tractably exploits origin-destination data, and draws from its optimization framework the flexibility 
        needed to take advantage of other sources of traffic information. Using synthetic data, we establish the robustness of our algorithm to uncertainty, and display
        its ability to significantly reduce input variance. We show empirically that our algorithm can leverage any available amount of data, even in a high-variance
        environment, to provide insights about urban traffic patterns on different scales, leading to accurate travel time estimations throughout the network.

        <p>This project, in partnership with Boston Public Schools, lies at the intersection of vehicle routing, large scale applications and public policy. Together with Dimitris Bertsimas and Arthur Delarue, we design novel school start time and bus routing optimization algorithm that outperform the state of the art. This work is implemented by the city of Boston, allowed it to save millions of dollars that are being reinvested into schools. Furthermore the city of Boston was the first to implement an analytically defined bell time choice policy, and uses our optimization algorithm to make fair and optimized decision.
