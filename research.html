          <strong>Abstract:</strong> This article presents a study on freeway networks instrumented with coordinated ramp metering and the ability of such control systems
          to produce arbitrarily complex congestion patterns within the dynamical limits of the traffic system. The developed method is used to
          evaluate the potential for an adversary with access to control infrastructure to enact high-level attacks on the underlying freeway system. 
          The attacks are executed using a predictive, coordinated ramp metering controller based on finite-horizon optimal control 
          and multi-objective optimization techniques. The efficacy of the control schemes in carrying out the prescribed attacks is determined
          via simulations of traffic network models based on the cell transmission model with onramps modeled as queue buffers. 
          Freeway attacks with high-level objectives are presented on two illustrative examples: congestion-on-demand, 
          which aims to create precise, user-specified pockets of congestion, and catch-me-if-you-can, which attempts to aid a fleeing vehicle from pursuant vehicles.

          <strong>Abstract:</strong> With the emergence of new companies that offer transportation on demand at large scale and the availability of very large data sets,
          new challenges arise to develop vehicle routing optimization algorithms that are capable of solving very large real-time problems involving tens of thousands of
          customers per hour. In this paper, we develop generalizable algorithms that allow us to apply mixed integer optimization to the largest practical problem scale. 
          Our optimization framework, coupled with a novel backbone algorithm, allows us to dispatch in real time thousands of taxis serving more than 25,000 customers per
          hour using the real New York City demand data and routing network. We provide evidence from historical simulations to show that our algorithms improve upon the 
          performance of existing heuristics in real-world settings.

          <strong>Abstract:</strong> Twenty-first century urban planners have identified the understanding of complex city traffic patterns as a major priority, leading
          to a sharp increase in the amount and the diversity of traffic data being collected. For instance, taxi companies in an increasing number of major cities have
          started recording metadata for every individual car ride. In this paper, we show that we can leverage network optimization insights to extract accurate travel 
          time estimations from such origin-destination data, using information from a large number of taxi trips to reconstruct the traffic patterns in an entire city 
          on a variety of timescales. We develop a method that tractably exploits origin-destination data, and draws from its optimization framework the flexibility 
          needed to take advantage of other sources of traffic information. Using synthetic data, we establish the robustness of our algorithm to uncertainty, and display
          its ability to significantly reduce input variance. We show empirically that our algorithm can leverage any available amount of data, even in a high-variance
          environment, to provide insights about urban traffic patterns on different scales, leading to accurate travel time estimations throughout the network.
