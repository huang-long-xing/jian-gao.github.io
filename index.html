      <h1 class="page-header">PhD Candidate, MIT</h1> 
      <p>
        I am a 4th year PhD student, advised by Profs.
        <strong><a href="http://web.mit.edu/dbertsim/www/">Dimitris Bertsimas</a></strong> and
        <strong><a href="http://web.mit.edu/jaillet/www/">Patrick Jaillet</a></strong>.
        My primary research interests involve scaling traditional optimization and statistics algorithms
        to real world problems involving large datasets. I have the pleasure to partner with Boston Public School and 
        optimize their bus routes and school bell-times.

            <li>In Spring 2017, my team won the $30K <a href="https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/transportationchallenge">Boston Public Schools Transportation Challenge</a>. 
              Our solution is now implemented and we are routing tens of thousands of students to school every day. We are still working with the city to keep improving the system
              and change the schools bell-times.</li>
            <li>I worked as a software engineer intern at Google in Summer 2016, developing novel algorithms
                to improve maps and navigation data using large geolocation datasets (> 100Gb). </li>
            <li>In 2014, I was a visiting researcher for five months in UC Berkeley under <a href="http://bayen.eecs.berkeley.edu">Pr. Alexandre Bayen</a> supervision.</li>
            <li>In 2013 won a <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/fondation/prix-jean-louis-gerondeau-zodiac-aerospace"> â‚¬10K innovation prize</a> for a smart bicycle start-up project.</p>

          <p>I have been a teaching assistant, for a MBA Analytics class at the Sloan School of Management in 2016, and a Probability class at the MIT Electrical Engineering and Computer Science
            department in 2017. I was also a member of the teaching staff for an Analytics class on the online platform EdX for thousands of students in 2017. I also lectured in a <a href="https://philchodrow.github.io/cos_2017/">graduate class</a> about Operations Research software tools in 2016 and 2017.</p>
