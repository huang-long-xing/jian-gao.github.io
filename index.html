          My research is in the areas of optimization and machine learning, with applications in transportation and public policy. My current focus is to scale traditional optimization and machine learning algorithms to real world problems involving large datasets. I have the pleasure to partner with <a href="https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/">Boston Public School</a> to optimize their bus routes and school bell-times.

          <li>In Spring 2017, I won the $30K <a href="https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/transportationchallenge">Boston Public Schools Transportation Challenge</a> together with <a href="https://adelarue.github.io/">Arthur Delarue</a> and Dimitris Bertsimas. 
          Our bus routing algorithm is now implemented and <b>we are routing tens of thousands of students to school every day</b>. It saves $5M dollars every year, reallocated to better serve the children of Boston.</li>
          <li>I worked as a software engineer intern at <strong>Google</strong> in Summer 2016, developing novel algorithms
              to improve maps and navigation data using large geolocation datasets (> 100Gb). </li>
          <li>In 2014, I was a visiting researcher for five months in <strong>UC Berkeley</strong> under <a href="http://bayen.eecs.berkeley.edu">Pr. Alexandre Bayen</a> supervision.</li>
          <li>In 2013 won a <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/fondation/prix-jean-louis-gerondeau-zodiac-aerospace"> â‚¬10K innovation prize</a> for a smart bicycle <strong>start-up</strong> project.</p>
