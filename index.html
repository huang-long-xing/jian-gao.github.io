      I am an Assistant Professor in Operations at the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/"></a> Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. Previously, I earned a MSc in applied math at <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">École polytechnique</a>, a PhD in operations research at <a href="https://orc.mit.edu/">MIT</a>, and did a post-doc at <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a>.

          My research is at the interface of optimization, transportation and policy. Transportation is becoming more and more complex in the age of the sharing economy, and my work focuses on the design of scalable algorithms and decision making tools that both improve transportation efficiency and positively affect society.

          During my PhD, I partnered with <a href="https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/">Boston Public School</a> to optimize their <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/print/WSJ_-A002-20170812.pdf">bus routes</a> and <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/ideas/graphics/2018/09/equity-machine/">school start times</a>. This work saved the district millions of dollars annually, and paved the way to improve the social equity of school start time assignment. It was selected as an <a href="https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/INFORMS-Prizes/Franz-Edelman-Award">Edelman award</a> finalist.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then spent a year at <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a>'s Marketplace Labs where I developed new algorithms and products for the ride-sharing industry. This work led to several implementations and patents, and had a positive impact on hundreds of thousands of drivers and passengers.
