    Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in operations management at UCLA Anderson School of Management, where I am advised by Prof.
 <a href="https://fcocastro.github.io/">Francisco Castro</a> and Prof. <a href="https://sebastienmartin.info">SÃ©bastien Martin</a>.
</p>
<p>
    My research interests are in interactions between humans and autonomous technologies. 
In particular, I aim to provide important insights on autonomous technologies to policymakers and other stakeholders by integrating principles from economics, statistics, and computer science.
So far, my work has focused on (1) modeling the strategic behavior of relevant stakeholders in the context of employing autonomous technologies; 
(2) analyzing both individual and societal consequences of utilizing these technologies with strategic behaviors.
