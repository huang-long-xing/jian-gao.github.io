    Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in operations management at UCLA Anderson School of Management, where I am advised by Prof.
 <a href="https://fcocastro.github.io/">Francisco Castro</a> and Prof. <a href="https://sebastienmartin.info">SÃ©bastien Martin</a>.
</p>
<p>
    My research interests are in the interaction between humans and autonomous technologies such as artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles.
In particular, I aim to provide structural insights into autonomous technologies for policymakers and other stakeholders by integrating principles from economics, statistics, information theory, and computer science.
