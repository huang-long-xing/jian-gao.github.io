      I am an Assistant Professor in Operations at the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/"></a> Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University. Previously, I earned a MSc in applied math at <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/">École polytechnique</a>, a PhD in operations research at <a href="https://orc.mit.edu/">MIT</a>, and did a post-doc at <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a>.

          My research focuses on the interface of optimization, transportation and policy. Transportation systems become more and more complex in the age of the sharing economy, and I focus on the design of decision-making tools that allows the to be more efficient and positively affect society.

          During my PhD, I partnered with <a href="https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/">Boston Public School</a> to optimize their <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/print/WSJ_-A002-20170812.pdf">bus routes</a> and <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/ideas/graphics/2018/09/equity-machine/">school start times</a>. This work saved the district millions of dollars annually, and paved the way to improve the social equity of school start time assignment. It was selected as an <a href="https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/INFORMS-Prizes/Franz-Edelman-Award">Edelman award</a> finalist.
        </p>
        <p>
          I then spent a year at <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a>'s Marketplace Labs where I developed new algorithms and products for the ride-sharing industry. This work led to several implementations and patents, and had a positive impact on hundreds of thousands of drivers and passengers.

          <li>My research papers are listed <a href="https://sebmart.github.io/research.html">here</a>.</li>
          <li>In September 2018, I <a href="https://apps.bostonglobe.com/ideas/graphics/2018/09/equity-machine/">collaborated</a> with the Boston Globe and Boston Public Schools to study the impact of changing the start times in Boston, with a potential for $18M in yearly savings for the district, better student health and equity.</li>
          <li>In Spring 2017, I won the $30K <a href="https://www.bostonpublicschools.org/transportationchallenge">Boston Public Schools Transportation Challenge</a> together with <a href="https://adelarue.github.io/">Arthur Delarue</a> and Dimitris Bertsimas. 
          Our bus routing algorithm is now implemented and <b>we are routing tens of thousands of students to school every day</b>. It saves $5M dollars every year, reallocated to better serve the children of Boston.</li>
          <li>I worked as a software engineer intern at <strong>Google</strong> in Summer 2016, developing novel algorithms
              to improve maps and navigation data using large geolocation datasets (> 100Gb). </li>
          <li>In 2014, I was a visiting researcher for five months in <strong>UC Berkeley</strong> under <a href="http://bayen.eecs.berkeley.edu">Pr. Alexandre Bayen</a> supervision.</li>
          <li>In 2013 won a <a href="https://www.polytechnique.edu/fondation/prix-jean-louis-gerondeau-zodiac-aerospace"> €10K innovation prize</a> for a smart bicycle <strong>start-up</strong> project.</p>
