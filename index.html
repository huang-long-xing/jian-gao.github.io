title: "About me"
---
<p>
    I am an Assistant Professor in Operations at the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/"> Kellogg School of Management</a>, Northwestern University.
</p>

<p>
    My research is at the interface of analytics, transportation and public policy.
    Specifically, I design scalable algorithms and decision making tools that both improve transportation efficiency and <em>positively affect society</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Notably, I work with school districts (San Francisco, Boston) to improve their transportation policies and save <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/print/WSJ_-A002-20170812.pdf">millions of dollars</a>, using algorithm to design transparent and equitable policies.
    I am also a consultant for the ridesharing company <a href="https://www.lyft.com/">Lyft</a>, for which I develop and implement algorithms and products that positively impact millions of drivers and passengers.
