    I am an Assistant Professor in Operations at the <a href="https://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/"> Kellogg School of Management</a>, Northwestern University.

    My research is at the interface of analytics, transportation and public policy.
    Specifically, I design scalable algorithms and decision making tools that both improve transportation efficiency and <em>positively affect society</em>.
</p>

    Notably, I work with school districts (San Francisco, Boston) to save <a href="http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/print/WSJ_-A002-20170812.pdf">millions of dollars</a> for public eduction and to improve the equity and transparency of their policies.
