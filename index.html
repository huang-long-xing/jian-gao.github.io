    Hi! I am a Ph.D. candidate in operations management at UCLA Anderson School of Management, where I am advised by Prof.
 <a href="https://fcocastro.github.io/">Francisco Castro</a> and Prof. <a href="https://sebastienmartin.info">SÃ©bastien Martin</a>.
</p>
<p>
    My research interests are in interactions between humans and autonomous technologies. 
In particular, I aim to provide important insights into autonomous technologies for policymakers and other stakeholders by integrating principles from economics, statistics, information theory, and computer science.
So far, my work has focused on (1) modeling the strategic behavior of relevant stakeholders in the context of autonomous technologies; 
(2) analyzing the individual and societal consequences of employing these technologies as they interface with humans.
